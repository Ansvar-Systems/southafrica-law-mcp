# Privacy & Client Confidentiality

**IMPORTANT READING FOR LEGAL PROFESSIONALS**

This document addresses privacy and confidentiality considerations when using this Tool, with particular attention to professional obligations under South African legal professional rules.

---

## Executive Summary

**Key Risks:**
- Queries through Claude API flow via Anthropic cloud infrastructure
- Query content may reveal client matters and privileged information
- Law Society of South Africa (LSSA) and General Council of the Bar (GCB) rules require strict confidentiality and data handling controls

**Safe Use Options:**
1. **General Legal Research**: Use Tool for non-client-specific queries
2. **Local npm Package**: Install `@ansvar/southafrica-law-mcp` locally — database queries stay on your machine
3. **Remote Endpoint**: Vercel Streamable HTTP endpoint — queries transit Vercel infrastructure
4. **On-Premise Deployment**: Self-host with local LLM for privileged matters

## Data Flows and Infrastructure

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Architecture

This Tool uses the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to communicate with AI clients:

```
User Query -> MCP Client (Claude Desktop/Cursor/API) -> Anthropic Cloud -> MCP Server -> Database
```

### Deployment Options

#### 1. Local npm Package (Most Private)

```bash
npx @ansvar/southafrica-law-mcp
```

- Database is local SQLite file on your machine
- No data transmitted to external servers (except to AI client for LLM processing)
- Full control over data at rest

#### 2. Remote Endpoint (Vercel)

```
Endpoint: https://southafrica-law-mcp.vercel.app/mcp
```

- Queries transit Vercel infrastructure
- Tool responses return through the same path
- Subject to Vercel's privacy policy

### What Gets Transmitted

When you use this Tool through an AI client:

- **Query Text**: Your search queries and tool parameters
- **Tool Responses**: Statute text, provision content, search results
- **Metadata**: Timestamps, request identifiers

**What Does NOT Get Transmitted:**
- Files on your computer
- Your full conversation history (depends on AI client configuration)

## Professional Obligations (South Africa)

### Legal Practice Act and Professional Rules

South African legal practitioners are bound by strict confidentiality rules under the Legal Practice Act 28 of 2014 and the respective codes of conduct of the LSSA and GCB.

#### Legal Professional Privilege

- All attorney-client and advocate-client communications are privileged
- Client identity may be confidential in sensitive matters
- Case strategy and legal analysis are protected
- Information that could identify clients or matters must be safeguarded

### POPIA and Client Data Processing

Under the **Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA, 2013)** and the conditions for lawful processing:

- You are the **Responsible Party** when processing client personal information
- AI service providers (Anthropic, Vercel) may be **Operators** (data processors)
- An **Operator Agreement** may be required under Section 21
- Ensure adequate technical and organizational measures
- The **Information Regulator** oversees compliance with POPIA

---

## Risk Assessment by Use Case

### LOW RISK: General Legal Research

**Safe to use through any deployment:**

```
Example: "What does the Companies Act say about director fiduciary duties?"
```

- No client identity involved
- No case-specific facts
- Publicly available legal information

### MEDIUM RISK: Anonymized Queries

**Use with caution:**

```
Example: "What are the penalties for BEE fronting under South African law?"
```

- Query pattern may reveal you are working on a BEE compliance matter
- Anthropic/Vercel logs may link queries to your API key

### HIGH RISK: Client-Specific Queries

**DO NOT USE through cloud AI services:**

- Remove ALL identifying details
- Use the local npm package with a self-hosted LLM
- Or use commercial legal databases with proper operator agreements

## Recommendations

### For Solo Practitioners / Small Firms

1. Use local npm package for maximum privacy
2. General research: Cloud AI is acceptable for non-client queries
3. Client matters: Use commercial legal databases (Juta, LexisNexis South Africa, Sabinet)

### For Large Firms / Corporate Legal

1. Negotiate operator agreements with AI service providers under POPIA Section 21
2. Consider on-premise deployment with self-hosted LLM
3. Train staff on safe vs. unsafe query patterns

### For Government / Public Sector

1. Use self-hosted deployment, no external APIs
2. Follow South African government information security requirements (MISS)
3. Air-gapped option available for classified matters
